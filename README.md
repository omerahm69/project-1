# project-1
 
This project is about the Urban Heritage of Massawa. An Eritrean civil initiative that seeks to document and protect the urban heritage of the ancient city of Massawa and spread awareness about it. The purpose of the website is informative gathering information about the old city of Massawa and the most important historical buildings to be protected. 

The main feature of the website is its simplicity. 
1. As a user I need to navigate through the website easily. The horizontal, fixed text-based navigation bar make it possible.
2. As a user I need to contact the administration of the website incase I need to reach them, having the contact us in the navigation bar make it easier to get in touch with them.
3. If I am a user, I need to have some more options to get in touch with the initiative and the possibility of using a phone number or E-mail address make it easier. 
4. As a user, I need to see consistency throughout the website, choosing a few colors and using them throughout the website giving me this consistency.

Below is the design I have chosen to build the site. The design is consistent throughout the site.
