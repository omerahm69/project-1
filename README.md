# project-1
 
This project is about the Urban Heritage of Massawa. An Eritrean civil initiative that seeks to document and protect the urban heritage of the ancient city of Massawa and spread awareness about it. 

Goals of the project is:
1. Is intended to be informative specially for Eritreans in diaspora in general and the new generation who born in exile
2. Gathering information about the old city of Massawa and the most important historical buildings to be protected 
3. Thie site is intended to be a documentary site that documents all related materials, images, videos and publication

Features:
The main feature of the website is its simplicity. 
1. As a user I need to navigate through the website easily. The horizontal, fixed text-based navigation bar make it possible.
2. As a user I need to contact the administration of the website incase I need to reach them, having the contact us in the navigation bar make it easier to get in touch with them.
3. If I am a user, I need to have some more options to get in touch with the initiative and the possibility of using E-mail address or facbook make it easier.
4. As a user, I need to see consistency throughout the website, choosing a few colors and using them throughout the website giving me this consistency.

Wireframe
