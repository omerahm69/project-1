# project-1
This project is about the Urban Heritage of Massawa. An Eritrean civil initiative that seeks to document and protect the urban heritage of the ancient city of Massawa and spread awareness about it.
The goals of the project are:
- It is intended to be informative especially for Eritreans in the diaspora in general and the new generation born in exile
- Gathering information about the old city of Massawa and the most important historical buildings to be protected
- It is also intended to be a documentary site that documents all related materials, images, videos, and publication

## Features
The main feature of the website is its simplicity.
- As a user, I need to navigate through the website easily. The horizontal, fixed text-based navigation bar makes it possible.
- As a user I need to contact the administration of the website in case I need to reach them, having the contact us in the navigation bar makes it easier to get in touch with them.
- As a user, I need more options to get in touch with the initiative, and the possibility of using the E-mail address or Facebook makes it easier.
- As a user, I need to see consistency throughout the website, choosing a few colors and using them throughout the website gives me this consistency.

### Existing Features in each page
