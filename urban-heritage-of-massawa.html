                    <br>
                    <p> Eritrea has a diverse urban heritage, which is a continuum of links spanning through the
                    ages. An urban heritage that was built according to a distinguished scientific engineering
                    that takes into account the cultural values and the environmental challenges of the
                    climate, which must be documented, protected and restored.
                    </p>
                
                    <br>

                    <h2>Classification of the urban heritage in Eritrea chronologically:</h2>

                    <ol style="list-style-type:circle;"> 

                        <li>Ancient Era: Gezi, Greek and Roman civilizations in the city of Adulis and Gezia in
                        the cities of Kohito, Matara and Debarwa </li>
                   
                        <li>  The Middle Ages: Islamic civilization in the city of Massawa and the island of
                        Dahlak</li>

                        The urban heritage in the cities of the ancient era is mostly buried underground and
                       needs research and exploration work, but the urban heritage in medieval and modern
                       cities still exists above the ground and is visible, so documenting it does not require
                       much effort

                    <p> Asmara is the capital and largest city of Eritrea. It was built by the Italians at the beginning
                    of the twentieth century to be the modern capital of the colony of Eritrea.
                    
                    The Eritrean National Commission for UNESCO prepared the candidacy file of the capital,
                    Asmara (the modern city of Africa) for the UNESCO World Heritage List, which was
                    accepted and registered in the final list of World Heritage in 2017.
