                    The methodology and electronic toolkit developed in the context of a project entitled "Urban Cultural Heritage in Conflict Zones" funded by the German Federal Foreign Office and implemented by GIZ under the umbrella of the Archaeological Heritage Network (ArcHerNet) will be used.
                    <span> This toolkit covers four main topics:</span>
                    <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>

                        <span> Planning </span>
                        Each topic of the above focuses on the main tasks required to protect and recover elements of urban cultural heritage

                        Urban Heritage in Eritrea </h2>
                        <p> Eritrea has a diverse urban heritage, which is a continuum of links spanning through the
                        ages. An urban heritage that was built according to distinguished scientific engineering
                        that takes into account the cultural values and the environmental challenges of the
                        climate, which must be documented, protected, and restored.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Classification of the urban heritage in Eritrea chronologically:</h2>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Ancient Era: Gezi, Greek, and Roman civilizations in the city of Adulis and Gezia in
                        the cities of Kohito, Matara, and Debarwa </li>
                        <li>The Middle Ages: Islamic civilization in the city of Massawa and the island of
                        Dahlak</li>
                        <li> Modern era: Modern European civilization: in the city of Asmara and the city of
                        Massawa</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                        The urban heritage in the cities of the ancient era is mostly buried underground and
                        needs research and exploration work, but the urban heritage in medieval and modern
                        cities still exist above the ground and are visible, so documenting them does not require
                        much effort
