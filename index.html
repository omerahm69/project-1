                    <h3> Geographical overview of the city of Massawa</h3>

                <br>

                    <p> Massawa is the second most important city & the main
                    port in Eritrea, which is located on the coast of the Red Sea,
                    one of the most important international trade lines, and it
                    was an important historical port for several centuries.
                    
                    <br>

                     The city is located on the southwestern coast of the Red
                    Sea at the northern end of the Gulf of Zula & is followed by
                    a group of islands known as the Dahlak Archipelago.
                    
                    <br>

                    Qadam mountain range. The city consists of mainland
                    Massawa and its suburbs, and three islands, Batse, Tualud
                    and Sheikh Saeed.
