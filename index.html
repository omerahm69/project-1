                <br>

                <p> The city is considered a mosaic carrying in its folds a mixture of residents and dialects, like all
                the ports in the world. <br> The immigrants and merchants coming from all countries settled in it, and mixed
                with its residents and set up their businesses. Everyone lived in it like an open museum that differed from
                the rest of their surroundings.</p>

                    <h3> Geographical overview of the city of Massawa</h3>

                <br>

                    <p> Massawa is the second most important city & the main
                    port in Eritrea, which is located on the coast of the Red Sea,
                    one of the most important international trade lines, and it
                    was an important historical port for several centuries.
                    
                    <br>

                     The city is located on the southwestern coast of the Red
                    Sea at the northern end of the Gulf of Zula & is followed by
                    a group of islands known as the Dahlak Archipelago.
                    
                    <br>

                     Most of its parts are surrounded by the Red Sea and the
                    Qadam mountain range. The city consists of mainland
                    Massawa and its suburbs, and three islands, Batse, Tualud
